      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I am a dedicated frontend developer with a passion for creating
        engaging and user-friendly web applications. With a strong foundation
        in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I strive to build responsive designs that
        provide an optimal user experience across all devices.

        My journey in web development began several years ago, and since then,
        I have continuously honed my skills and stayed updated with the latest
        industry trends. I enjoy collaborating with cross-functional teams to
        bring innovative ideas to life.
      </p>
      <p>
        When I'm not coding, I love exploring new technologies, contributing to
        open-source projects, and sharing knowledge with the developer community.
