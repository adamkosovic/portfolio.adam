        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>
          I recently completed a <strong>two-year Frontend Development program</strong>,
          where I built a strong foundation in modern web development.
          My primary focus has been on Angular and TypeScript, working with
          component-based architectures to create scalable and maintainable applications.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          Throughout my studies, I gained hands-on experience with
          <strong>responsive design</strong>, state management, REST APIs,
          and Git-based version control.
          I value clean, structured code and actively focus on improving
          performance and user experience.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          Alongside frontend development, I have developed a growing interest in
          <strong>backend development</strong>.
          I am motivated to expand my knowledge in server-side logic, databases,
          and API development, with the long-term goal of becoming a
          full-stack developer.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          I consider myself a <strong>curious, motivated, and detail-oriented developer</strong>
          who enjoys learning new technologies and continuously refining my technical skills.

    <ng-container *ngIf="activeTab === 'interests'">
      <div class="panel">
        <h2>My interests</h2>
        <p>
          Outside of work and studies, I value spending time with my
          <strong>family and close relationships</strong>.
          I believe communication, collaboration, and balance are important
          both in life and in a professional environment.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          I have a strong interest in <strong>sports and physical training</strong>
          and regularly play football.
          Staying active helps me maintain focus, discipline, and energy
          in my everyday work.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          I also enjoy <strong>traveling</strong>, which has strengthened my ability
          to adapt to new environments and perspectives.
          In my free time, I often continue developing my skills by learning
          new programming concepts, exploring new technologies,
          and working on personal coding projects.
