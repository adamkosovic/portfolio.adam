        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>
          I recently completed a <strong>two-year Frontend Development education</strong>,
          where I have built a solid foundation in <strong>modern web development</strong>.
          My main technical focus has been on <strong>Angular</strong> and
          <strong>TypeScript</strong>, which I have used to develop
          <strong>component-based, scalable, and maintainable applications</strong>.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          During my studies, I worked with concepts such as
          <strong>responsive design</strong>, <strong>state management</strong>,
          <strong>REST APIs</strong>, and <strong>version control with Git</strong>.
          I enjoy writing clean, structured code and continuously improving both
          <strong>performance</strong> and <strong>user experience</strong>.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          In addition to frontend development, I have developed a growing interest in
          <strong>backend development</strong>. I am motivated to expand my knowledge in
          areas such as <strong>server-side logic</strong>, <strong>databases</strong>,
          and <strong>API development</strong>, with the goal of becoming a
          <strong>full-stack developer</strong> in the future.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          I am a <strong>curious, motivated, and detail-oriented developer</strong>
          who enjoys learning new technologies and continuously improving my technical
          skills.

      <div class="panel">
        <h2>My interests</h2>
        <p>
          Outside of work and studies, I spend a lot of time with my
          <strong>family</strong>, <strong>girlfriend</strong>, and
          <strong>friends</strong>. I value collaboration, communication, and balance,
          which I believe are important qualities both professionally and personally.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          I am very interested in <strong>sports and physical training</strong> and
          regularly play <strong>football</strong>. Staying active helps me maintain
          focus, discipline, and energy in my daily work.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          I also enjoy <strong>traveling</strong>, which has strengthened my ability to
          adapt to new environments and perspectives. In my free time, I often continue
          to develop my skills by <strong>learning new programming concepts</strong>,
          <strong>exploring new technologies</strong>, and working on
          <strong>personal coding projects</strong>.
